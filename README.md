# NLP_assignment-3-1

**Instruction-Based Dataset Generation and Model Fine-Tuning in LLMs**

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to explore the process of generating an instructionbased dataset for model training in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Additionally, students will
fine-tune a pre-trained model using the newly created instruction-based dataset and compare its
performance with the original instructions. Moreover, they will test how the model behaves before
and after training with general purpose instructions which the model was originally trained.
Tasks:
1. Instruction-Based Dataset Generation (50 pts):
a. Select any non-instruction-based dataset from a previously available source in NLP (e.g.,
text classification, sentiment analysis, code analysis etc.).
b. Use ChatGPT Mistral, Gemini or similar language generation models to create at least two
sets of clear and concise instructions for each task represented in the dataset. Ensure that
the instructions are relevant to the tasks and provide guidance on how to perform them
effectively. For example: “Find the vulnerability class in the following code?” or “Repair
the vulnerability of the given code?”
c. Convert the original dataset into an instruction-based dataset by appending the
generated instructions to each data instance (each row of the dataset).
2. Model Fine-Tuning (15 pts):
a. Find a pre-trained LLM which you want to use for this assignment (make sure data to
train the original model is available).
b. Fine-tune the same pre-trained LLM using the instruction-based dataset generated in
Task 1. Save the model.
c. Again, fine-tune the original pre-trained LLM by combining your instruction dataset and
the original dataset the model was initially trained on. Save your model.
3. Comparison (35 pts):
a. Evaluate the saved model from 2.b and 2.b an on your proposed dataset and write a
descriptive analysis on the results. Create a table like the sample table provided.
b. Create 10 instructions completely out-of-sample from your dataset, that produces good
results on the original pre-trained model. Use these instructions to generate inference
from the original pre-trained model, and the model you saved in 2b and 2c. Write a
comparison analysis on the outcome from various stages of trained models.

*About Dataset
IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

This table illustrates the improvements in model performance after fine-tuning on different metrics.

**Critical Analysis**

Performance Improvement
The data shown in the table illustrates a consistent improvement across all metrics after fine-tuning. Specifically, the models fine-tuned in steps 2.b and 2.c demonstrate incremental improvements in BLEU, Rouge-L, BERTScore, and CodeBLEU:

BLEU, Rouge-L, and BERTScore: These metrics show a linear improvement, which suggests that the fine-tuning process has effectively enhanced the model's understanding and generation capabilities concerning the linguistic elements of the dataset.
CodeBLEU: This metric improves from 40.0 in the original pre-trained model to 48.0 in the model fine-tuned with the combined dataset. This indicates better handling and understanding of code-specific elements, such as syntax and semantics, which are crucial in datasets involving code.
Benefits of Further Fine-Tuning
Further fine-tuning with a combination of the original and instruction-based datasets (step 2.c) led to the highest scores in all metrics. This indicates:

Enhanced Generalization: Incorporating diverse training data enhances the model's ability to generalize better to unseen data, a critical factor in achieving robust performance in real-world applications.
Specificity to Task: The continuous improvement in CodeBLEU suggests that the iterative fine-tuning process increasingly adapts the model to better handle code-related tasks, which might include understanding code snippets, generating code comments, or even synthesizing code.
Analysis and Future Directions
While the fine-tuning has significantly improved performance, continued enhancements could likely be achieved by:

Expanding the Dataset: Including more varied examples from different sources could help improve the robustness of the model against overfitting and underfitting scenarios.
Experimenting with Hyperparameters: Adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters could further optimize training outcomes.
Cross-validation: Implementing cross-validation during training could provide a clearer insight into the model's performance and stability across different subsets of data.
